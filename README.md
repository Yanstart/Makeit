## Overview

The MakeitGreen Browser Extension is a project created by a team of enthusiastic IT students participating in a hackathon focused on sustainable development. Our mission is to develop a browser extension that assesses web pages' environmental impact by assigning them a score concept. The extension aims to help users make eco-conscious choices while browsing the web.

## Project Description

In a world where energy consumption is a growing concern, our vision for 2050 is to provide a tool that empowers internet users to make sustainable choices online. The GreenScore Browser Extension evaluates web pages and provides a score that reflects their energy efficiency. This score considers various factors, such as server load, resource optimization, and overall sustainability practices.

### Future Enhancements

We envision expanding the GreenScore extension to evaluate not only energy consumption but also web accessibility. Our long-term goal is to offer a range of services, including server load optimization recommendations for backend applications. By doing so, we hope to contribute to a more sustainable and accessible internet.
